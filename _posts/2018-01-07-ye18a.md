title: Analytical Techniques for Anomaly Detection Through Features, Signal-Noise
  Separation and Partial-Value Association
year: '2017'
section: Invited Talks
abstract: 'This paper presents three analytical techniques for anomaly detection which
  can play an important role for anomaly detection in finance: the feature extraction
  technique, the signal-noise separation technique, and the Partial-Value Association
  Discovery (PVAD) algorithm. The feature extraction technique emphasizes the importance
  of extracting various data features which may be better at separating anomalies
  from norms than using raw data. The signal-noise separation technique considers
  an anomaly as the signal to detect and the norm as the noise and employs both anomaly
  models and norm models to detect anomalies accurately. The PVAD algorithm enables
  learning from data to build anomaly patterns and norm patterns which capture both
  partial-value and full-value variable relations as well as interactive, concurrent
  effects of multiple variables.'
