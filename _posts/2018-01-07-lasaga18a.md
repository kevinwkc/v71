title: Deep Learning to Detect Medical Treatment Fraud
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Talks
abstract: Excessive treatment or testing of patients is considered one of the most
  ubiquitous and persistent forms of waste and abuse in healthcare. Some estimates
  show excessive treatment to be as high as 8% of all medical insurance provider expenditures.
  It is very difficult to identify an extraneous or unnecessary procedure or drug
  because there is such a wide variety of diagnoses and an equally large number of
  treatment options. Our goal in this paper was to show how RBMs can be utilized effectively
  to ferret out abnormal treatments where the prescribed treatment for a given diagnosis
  is not strictly followed. To test our hypothesis we generated 200,000 different
  injuries and injected 10% of the injuries with unnecessary treatments to reflect
  estimated industry prevalence levels. Using testing and training sets we found that
  Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) were able to reach AUCs of .95, lifts at 9.5
  and recalls at 50%. Implementing our approach on real-world client datasets have
  shown performances levels that approach simulation performances despite additional
  noise.
