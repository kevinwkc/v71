title: An Automated System for Data Attribute Anomaly Detection
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Talks
abstract: We introduce DataQC, an automated system for data attribute anomaly detection
  for the purpose of improving data quality. Large organizations can have non-standardized
  or inconsistent data quality checking practices being followed across different
  departments. The key motivation behind the development of such a system is to 1)
  achieve a standard for anomaly detection 2) facilitate quick identification of obvious
  anomalies 3) reduce human judgment in data anomaly detection 4) facilitate prompt
  corrective action by data scientists. Most of the methods and techniques used during
  the development of this system are well known and have been widely used by finance
  professionals who deal with data. Our contribution is to provide a system that improves
  overall effciency, interpretability, and objectivity for detecting data attribute
  anomalies.
