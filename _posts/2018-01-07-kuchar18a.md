title: Spotlighting Anomalies using Frequent Patterns
year: '2017'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Approaches for anomaly detection based on frequent pattern mining follow
  the paradigm: if an instance contains more frequent patterns, it means that this
  data instance is unlikely to be an anomaly. This concept can be used in financial
  industry to reveal contextual anomalies. The main contribution of this paper is
  an approach that includes a novel formula for computation of anomaly scores. We
  evaluated the proposed approach on baseline datasets and present a use case on a
  real world financial dataset. We also propose a way how to explain the anomaly to
  the users. Implementations of the evaluated algorithms and experiments are available
  online in R.'
